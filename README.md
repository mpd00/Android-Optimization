# Android Firmware Optimization Project for Mobile Networks Course Spring 2023

Welcome to the Android Firmware Optimization Project for Mobile Networks Course Spring 2023 repository! This project is our interpretation of the asked questions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to optimize the firmware for Android with a focus on performance.
We made the optimizations using Android Kitchen, then flashed the modified firmware on a Huawei Honor 8 phone using SP Flash tool and eventually benchmarked the results using Antutu.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Firmware`: This is the link to our modified firmware on google drive.
- `Documentation`: This pdf document contains the documentations of all the procedures and modifications done using Android Kitchen as well as the results of benchmarks for both the vanilla firmware and our modified version.

## Resources

We used the following tools in our implementation:

- `SuperR's Kitchen`: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/linux-free-superrs-kitchen-v1-2-1-5-01-08-2022.3597434/
- `CRB Android Kitchen`: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/kitchen-windows-tool-crb-v3-2-5.3947779/
